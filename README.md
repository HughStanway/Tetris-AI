# Tetris AutoPlayer

The program plays tetris by choosing optimal move to achive the best score. The AutoPlayer simulates all possible combinations of the next 2 moves and ranks them by a score generated from given heuristsics. These heuristsics were optimised using a hill climb algorithm to optimise the AI.

The overall goal of the autoplayer in to achive the highest score possible in a given number of blocks and not just to survive for long periods of time.

The AutoPlayer can be found within player.py and the game can be played by running **python3 visual.py** or **python3 visual-pygame.py** in the directory.
