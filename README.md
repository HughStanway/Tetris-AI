# Tetris AutoPlayer

The program plays tetris by choosing optimal move to achive the best score. The AutoPlayer simulates all possible combinations of the next 2 moves and ranks them by a score generated from given heuristsics. These heuristsics were optimised using a hill climb algorithm to optimise the AI.
