# Tetris AutoPlayer

The program plays tetris by choosing optimal move to achive the best score. The AutoPlayer simulates all possible combinations of the next 2 moves and ranks them by a score generated from given heuristsics. These heuristsics were optimised using a hill climb algorithm to optimise the AI.

The overall goal of the autoplayer in to achive the highest score possible in a given number of blocks and not just to survive for long periods of time.

The AutoPlayer can be found within player.py and the game can be played by running python3 visual.py in the directory.
